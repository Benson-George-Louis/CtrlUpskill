# CtrlUpskill
This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects developed during my internship at CtrlUpksill, where I applied core web development principles using Django, HTML/CSS, and Git version control. These projects reflect my progress in writing clean, maintainable code and creating intuitive, user-focused designs.
